We can find a lot of similarities between the two cities: lake-shore cities, English as the predominant language, nearby the US-Canada border, etc. On the other hand, the two cities are also very different, for example, Toronto has larger area and population, Cleveland has warmer weather."

A successful Cleveland restaurant owner want to know if she can repeat her business in Toronto, where should the new restaurant be located. A real estate agent would recommend a house to his client who plan to move from Toronto to Cleveland but rather keep the similar living environment. Questions like these can related to anyone or any business area."
